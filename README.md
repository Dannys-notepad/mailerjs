# `MailerJs`
> A lightweight Script for sending mails

`MailerJs` is a simple lightweight script, for sending mails with nodejs, it makes sending mails fast and easy and can fit into your project due to its easy customizable nature.

With `MailerJs` you don't need to worry about errors, because it handles any potential error. 

## Requirement
To use `MailerJs` with your gmail account you'll need to create an app password in your goggle account.

To do that copy this link https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?rapt=AEjHL4O09_dsFEiMJQkZ53AtjhHYCFdPIQnCuq5Pdy0GURsLoIDtvswcm3q2N0jvnitc802fiViGNOah8hPwytVMRDgG7t3s5aReZCFBHOsJmbDzow2iW3E, and follow the procedures.

## Usage
To use `MailerJs` first of all create a .env file with the following structures. 


SMPT_USER = your email 

SMPT_PASS = your created app password


Once you're done, copy the code either the promises or asynchronous version, and paste in a mailer.js file in your project and you're good to go.
